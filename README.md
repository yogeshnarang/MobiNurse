## Developed for Hack It Out Team GithubNhiAata

Mobinurse uses AI to auto-generate prescriptions by hearing in on doctor-patient conversations and provides a world-class platform for doctors and patients to book, manage and attend appointments.


## Brief Overview
There’s a very evident reason on why we need to bring about a revolution in the healthcare system. The pandemic not just temporarily affected our lives, but also altered our livestyle permanently. 

There is a dire need of an organised platform that not only makes the experience seamless for the patients but also for the doctors.

Current solutions available in the market make the experience worthwhile for the patients but not enough for the doctors - which is why doctors are not making the shift to online appointments.

To solve this problem we’ve decided to build a All-In-One healthcare platform powered by AI on the backend. Here’s the incentive to shift to the platform - We offer no contact healthcare where in users can book online appointments, and talk with their doctors using our in house video meeting system. At the same time, we also offer something very unique in nature - 

What do doctors hate the most? WRITING PRESCRIPTIONS<br>
What do patients hate the most? READING INCOMPREHENSIBLE PRESCRIPTIONS

Our AI Bot writes the prescription for you, by hearing in on your patient doctor meetings and don’t worry - we never save your data.

- No contact healthcare
- No messy prescriptions anymore -> Automatic generation of prescriptions using our inhouse AI Bot.
